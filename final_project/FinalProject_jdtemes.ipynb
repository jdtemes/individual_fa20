    "Community cohesion relies on engagement. There is no physical, sticky glue binding us down; our adhesive is mutual familiarity and social contact. In fact, social contact theory is the idea that simply doing an activity with people of a different demographic group, is enough to open one up to greater diversity. The research into that claim has been mixed, but there is evidence that at the individual level, people from deeply divided groups are willing to form friendships with each other if they have played together in sports teams.<sup>1</sup>\n",

    "Recreational centers then, are an important part of our communities. At rec centers, locals of all ages get a chance to interact with each other and foster their sense of community. That is good not only in and of itself, but for the sake of public safety and the wellbeing of local kids. Perceiving local goods and resources as your own has shown to prevent mistreatment of those resources.<sup>2</sup> David Kurtz, formerly with the National Recreation and Park Association, argues that recreation centers can help turn kids away from a future of crime.<sup>3</sup>\n",

    "I asked a simple question for this project. Simple questions can result in basic answers that do not elaborate much on what larger patterns exist. I think this is concerning, because if it appears that the only issue with community cohesion has to do with the location of rec centers, then anyone who is uninterested in reading more about the topic might come to simple conclusions about deep sociological problems. That can be problematic in political systems (democracies) that rely on a properly informed electorate. I had fun with this project, genuinely, but am I admitting to having come up with a problematically poor question? Perhaps."

    "My hypothesis was incorrect. While I expected recreation centers to exist primarily at parks that were run by the most local division of government possible, it turns out that they are primarily run by a division of government that is one step higher. The park_type \"regional\" turned out to have the highest percentage of recreation centers, at roughly 16%, while only 5% of local parks were home to rec centers. Ultimately, I think that there are deeper questions to ask about the role recreation centers play in our communities. I am curious about the funding that individual rec centers receive, and whether that has an effect on local crime rates, or a correlation to the performance of nearby schools."
